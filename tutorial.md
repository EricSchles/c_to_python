#Making use of C for Python

The intention of this tutorial is to teach you how to leverage the speed of C in Python.  More or less, we will be writing C code that acts much the way a database would, expect without the bloatware associated with a database.  Of course, databases are phonemonal, general, problem solving engines, with the ability to solve many, many problems.  And that is the exactly the reason writing straight C can be faster, it's made to solve one data storage problem, not all of them.  Of course, just because C can be faster, doesn't mean it will be.  That will be up to you, the reader, to make your C code fast.  

##If you don't know C

If you don't know C, but want to master it, I'd recommend checking out the c_primer.md associated with this repo, as well as reading the K&R book (2nd addition).
