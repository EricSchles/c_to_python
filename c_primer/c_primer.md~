#C Primer

Welcome to the C programming language.  In this tutorial we'll be going through the primitives of C.  

What we'll cover:

* Primitives
  * Printing to the Screen
  * Basic Math
  * Variables - storing state
  * for/while loops
  * functions
* Data Structures
  * Arrays
  * Structs
  * Pointers
    * Basic Pointers
    * Array Pointers
    * Function Pointers
  * Linked Lists
    * Singly Linked Lists
    * Doubly Linked Lists
    * Skip Lists
    * Stacks/Queues 
  * Trees
    * Binary Search Trees
    * Red/Black Trees, AVL Trees
  * Heaps
    * Priority Queues
  * Graphs
  * HashMaps
* Algorithms
  * Sorting
  * List Traversal
  * Graph Traversal
  * Shortest Path
  * Numerical Methods and computations

##Primitives

The C language has great primitives.  In fact after only understanding the basic data structures you are ready to make use of all of the power of the C language - blazing speed.
